# Projects based on DSA

## Mostly used programming languages C/C++

This folder contains various DSA **(Data Structures and Algorithms)** projects implemented in **C++.** Each project demonstrates the application of different data structures to solve specific problems efficiently. The projects are built using a variety of data structures including **Queues, Stacks, Linked Lists, Hash Maps, and Trees.** These projects showcase practical implementations and solutions that utilize the core concepts of each data structure, helping to enhance the understanding of algorithmic efficiency and **problem-solving techniques.**
